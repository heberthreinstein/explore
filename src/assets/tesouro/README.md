# AR Builders Treasure Hunt

* Users visit different AR image markers around the office to see Builders in AR
* When a user clicks a builder, the builder's dialogue appears
* Users can also view builder "tools" in AR
* Users can collect all the tools by viewing them
* When a user visits a builder who has specified a preference for a particular tool (e.g. maybe Pyra wants a hammer), the user can "gift" the tool to the builder to unlock new dialogue


Copy of CBRE Build AR Builders which can be viewed at https://ar-builders.cbrebuild.com/ (need to print the images in builder-markers directory to get the models to appear). I've removed the 3D models in the builder-models directory since I did not create them. Collaborated with https://github.com/KamillaKhabibrakhmanova
